			<h2>The basic components of the WWW</h2>
			<p>The web consists basically of three major components: <b>the client</b>, <b>the Server</b>, and <b>the infrastructure that connects them (Internet)</b>. the client is the web browser installed on, noramly, a PC. It's the part that sends the requests and receives them, then processes the received data and renders the output on the screen. the servers are the computers that receive the requests from the clients, then process them and serve the files and data requested. the internet is the connection or network that binds them together and even makes these types of communications physically possible to begin with. The main file type that is dealt with on the web is the <b>HTML</b> file type. HTML is an acronym for <em>Hypertext markup language</em>, which implies its purpose. it is a tool to create markups so that the browser can understand and format the input correctly. the main protocol to transfer files in the web is the <b>HTTP</b> protocol, which stands for <em>Hypertext transfer protocol</em>. this protocol is necessary for the transfer process and ensures that different parts of the system understand each other.</p>

			<h2>Basics of HTML</h2>
			<p>The HTML language uses so-called <b>tags</b> to convey information to the computer. Every tag directs the computer to process or format the data in a certain way. Tags can also have further information <b>attributes</b> to specify the instruction further. These attributes could be necessary for the tag to work or of rather aesthetical nature. As an example of attributes we mention the href attribute of the <b>a-tag</b>, which sepcifies the URL which we are linking to. Tags, normaly, come in pairs the opening tag and the closing one. There are certain types of tags that do not contain any data an so need not be followed by a closing tag. these tags are called <b>void tags</b>. Examples of tags are the <b>br-tag</b>, which instructs the browser to begin a new line. Browsers normaly treat any type of whitespace as a single space and treat any number of whitespaces as just one. Which means that another way is necessary to make the computer include a new line rather than just typing it in the file. Another example of tags is the <b>b-tag</b> which stands for bold. It causes the browser to show anything between the opening and closing tag in boldface. Tags can either be <b>inline tags</b> or <b>block tags</b>. The difference lies within <em>the way these two types work</em>. For example, we have the br-tag and the p-tag. Both of them cause the browser to include a new line. But the difference in those two is how they work. The br-tag <em>just instructs the computer to include a new line</em> where as the p-tag rather <em>instructs the computer to include the contents in a box with its own features</em>. Drawing this box causes a new line to appear between the contents of the p-tag and whatever follows it. So one sees the effect is nearly the same, but the causes are completely different. Another way in which br-tags and p-tags differ is the conceptual aspect. HTML is not only a language to instruct the computer to do things it is also for structuring the text <em>meaningfully and conceptually</em>, which means a p-tag should be used when a new paragraph begins which in turn should be the case when the author wants to jump to a new idea. Using both the technical aspects and the conceptual aspects of the HTML language is key for a good web developer. Further tools to structure an html document lie in span and div. the first is an inline tag the other is a block tag.</p>

			<h2>An HTML document</h2>
			<p>An HTML document consists normally of the <b>DOCTYPE-tag</b> at the beginning, specifying the type and standard of the html used in the document. Then an <b>html-tag</b> which includes all the content of the page. Then we have the <b>head-part</b> and the <b>body-part</b>. The head contains metadata which describes the page further and also could contribute new functionalities to the page, like better <em>search engine access</em> and even <em>client side scripts</em> in the browser to execute. The body part includes all <em>the visible page</em> which is ultimately shown to the user.</p>
