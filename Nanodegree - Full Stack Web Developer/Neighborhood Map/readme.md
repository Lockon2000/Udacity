* About the Neighborhood Map Project:

The Project demonstrates adequate use of external API Services (like Google Maps and the Wikipedia API) and third party Libraries (Like Knockout and JQuery). Separation of Concerns is handled according to the Knockouts MVVM model, utilizing its automatic UI refresh and dependency Tracking to minimize manual redrawing. JQuery is used to make AJAX requests to the Wikipedia API and to backup Knockouts. The interactions with the Google maps API forms the heart of the app. We retrieve a map and pinpoint some interesting locations on it using markers. These markers are fully interactive and upon clicking display some additional information about the sites, of course the data is returned asynchronously. Finally the app is made responsive through some cases @media rules and breakpoints.
